= Binding a {mobile-client} with the {sync-service} server application service

To use {product-name}, you must represent your mobile app in *Mobile Developer Console*, and that app must be associated with the mobile service.
This association is called *binding* and it is necessary for your mobile app to use that service.

To bind a {mobile-client} with a mobile service:

.Procedure

. Launch {mobile-developer-console}

. Click the {short-mobile-client} on the *Overview* screen

. Navigate to *Mobile Services* tab.

// end::excludeUpstream[]

// tag::excludeDownstream[]
image::mobile-clients-services-all-unbound.png[]
// end::excludeDownstream[]
+
NOTE: It is possible to bind a {mobile-client} with a mobile service in the OpenShift console; however, such bindings are not valid for the purposes of this procedure.

. Press *Bind to App* in the {service-name}
. Fill out the binding parameters required by the {service-name} Service.
