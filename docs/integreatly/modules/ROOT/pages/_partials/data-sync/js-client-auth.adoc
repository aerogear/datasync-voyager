= Implementing authentication and authorization on your client

With {sync-client}, user information can be passed to a {sync-service} server application in two ways: headers or tokens.

Headers are used to authentication HTTP requests to the server, which are used for queries and mutations.

Tokens are used to authenticate WebSocket connections, which are used for subscriptions.

Both of them can be set via the `authContextProvider` configuration option. Here is an example

[source, javascript]
----

//get the token value from somewhere, for example the authentication service
const token = "REPLACE_WITH_REAL_TOKEN";

const config = {
  ...
  authContextProvider: function() {
    return {
      header: {
        "Authorization": `Bearer ${token}`
      },
      token: token
    }
  },
  ...
};

//create a new client
