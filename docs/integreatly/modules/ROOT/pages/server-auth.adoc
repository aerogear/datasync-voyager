= Configuring your server for authentication and authorization using {idm-name}

Using the {keycloak-service} service and the link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aerogear/voyager-keycloak[@aerogear/voyager-keycloak] module, it is possible to add security to a {sync-server} application.

The `@aerogear/voyager-keycloak` module provides the following features out of the box:

* Authentication - Ensure only authenticated users can access your server endpoints, including the main GraphQL endpoint.
* Authorization - Use the `@hasRole()` directive within the GraphQL schema to implement role based access control (RBAC) on the GraphQL level.
* Integration with GraphQL context - Use the `context` object within the GraphQL resolvers to access user credentials and several helper functions.

.Prerequisites

* There is a {idm-name} service available.
* You must add a valid `keycloak.json` config file to your project.
  ** Create a client for your application in the Keycloak administration console.
  ** Click on the Installation tab.
  ** Select *Keycloak OIDC JSON* for Format option, and click *Download*.

== Protecting {sync-server} using {idm-name}

. Import the `@aerogear/voyager-keycloak` module

+
[source,javascript]
----
const { KeycloakSecurityService } = require('@aerogear/voyager-keycloak')
----

. Read the Keycloak config and pass it to initialise the `KeycloakSecurityService`.

+
[source,javascript]
----
const keycloakConfig = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, './path/to/keycloak.json')))
const keycloakService = new KeycloakSecurityService(keycloakConfig)
----

. Use the `keycloakService` instance to protect your app:

+
[source,javascript]
----
const app = express()
keycloakService.applyAuthMiddleware(app)
----

. Configure the Voyager server so that the `keycloakService` is used as the security service:
+
[source,javascript]
----
const voyagerConfig = {
  securityService: keycloakService
}
const server = VoyagerServer(apolloConfig, voyagerConfig)
----

The link:https://github.com/aerogear/voyager-server/blob/master/examples/keycloak[Keycloak Example Server Guide] has an example server based off the instructions above and shows all of the steps needed to get it running.

== Using the hasRole directive in a schema

The Voyager Keycloak module provides the `@hasRole` directive to define role based authorisation in your schema. The `@hasRole` directive is a special annotation that can be applied to

* Fields
* Queries
* Mutations
* Subscriptions

The `@hasRole` usage is as follows:

* `@hasRole(role: String)`
  * Example - `@hasRole(role: "admin"])`
  * If the authenticated user has the role `admin` they will be authorized.
* `@hasRole(role: [String])`
  * Example - `@hasRole(role: ["admin", "editor"])`
  * If the authenticated user has at least one of the roles in the list, they will be authorized.

The default behaviour is to check client roles. For example, `@hasRole(role: "admin")` will check that user has a client role called `admin`. `@hasRole(role: "realm:admin")` will check if that user has a realm role called `admin`

The syntax for checking a realm role is `@hasRole(role: "realm:<role>")`. For example, `@hasRole(role: "realm:admin")`. Using a list of roles, it is possible to check for both client and realm roles at the same time.

.Example: Using the @hasRole Directive to Apply Role Based Authorization in a Schema

The following example demonstrates how the `@hasRole` directive can be used to define role based authorization on various parts of a GraphQL schema. This example schema represents publishing application like a news or blog website.

[source,graphql]
----
type Post {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  author: Author!
  content: String!
  createdAt: Int!
}

type Author {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  posts: [Post]!
  address: String! @hasRole(role: "admin")
  age: Int! @hasRole(role: "admin")
}

type Query {
  allPosts:[Post]!
  getAuthor(id: ID!):Author!
}

type Mutation {
  editPost:[Post]! @hasRole(role: ["editor", "admin"])
  deletePost(id: ID!):[Post] @hasRole(role: "admin")
}
----

There are two types:

* `Post` - This might be an article or a blog post
* `Author` - This would represent the person that authored a Post

There are two Queries:

* `allPosts` - This might return a list of posts
* `getAuthor` - This would return details about an Author

There are two Mutations:

* `editPost` - This would edit an existing post
* `deletePost` - This would delete a post.

.Role Based Authorization on Queries and Mutations

In the example schema, the `@hasRole` directive has been applied to the `editPost` and `deletePost` mutations. The same could be done on Queries.

* Only users with the roles `editor` and/or `admin` are allowed to perform the `editPost` mutation.
* Only users with the role `admin` are allowed to perform the `deletePost` mutation.

This example shows how the `@hasRole` directive can be used on various queries and mutations.

.Role Based Authorization on Fields

In the example schema, the `Author` type has the fields `address` and `age` which both have `hasRole(role: "admin")` applied.

This means that users without the role `admin` are not authorized to request these fields in any query or mutation.

For example, non admin users are allowed to run the `getAuthor` query, but they cannot request back the `address` or `age` fields.
