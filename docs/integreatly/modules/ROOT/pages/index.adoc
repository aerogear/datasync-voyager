= Developing a {sync-service} Application
:page-partial:

Unlike other mobile services which provide a server and an API, Data Sync is a framework that you use to develop services. Typically, you develop a {sync-service} service as follows:

. Design a link:https://graphql.org/learn[GraphQL] schema.
. Develop a Data Sync server and Data Sync client, with the features you require, for example, real-time updates.
. Containerize your Data Sync server and deploy it to OpenShift.
//. Bind your mobile app to that Data Sync server.
. Configure your mobile app to point to the Data Sync server.
. Complete your mobile app development.
. Build and run your mobile app.
